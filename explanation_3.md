# Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits

I decided to use the merge sort algorithm to solve this problem because it has pretty good efficiency
and there was a single array in the input.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(log(n))    when n is the size of the input array
* Space complexity: 0(n)        when n is the size of the input array
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
