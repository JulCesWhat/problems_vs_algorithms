# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

Decided to use Trie Node data structure since we need to find prefixes of words and need to store
the values while using the least memory.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(n)    n is the size of the word being inserted
* Worse `set` time case complexity: O(n)    n is the size of the word being retrieved
* Space complexity: 0(n)        when n is the number of different characters being inserted
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
