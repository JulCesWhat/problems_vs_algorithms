# Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

I am not using any algorithm. I just decided to find the min and max numbers.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(n)    when n is the size of the input array.
* Space complexity: 0(1)
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
