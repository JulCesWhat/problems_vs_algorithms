# Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

I decided to use Trie Node structure to solve this problem because it was the best way to handle
the input routes.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(n)    when n is the number of different route paths
* Worse `set` time case complexity: O(n)    when n is the number of different route paths
* Space complexity: 0(n)        when n is the number of different route paths
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
