# Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

I implemented Newton's method of finding the square root of a number.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(log(n))   when n is the size of the number
* Space complexity: 0(1)
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
