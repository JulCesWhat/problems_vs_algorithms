# Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

I decided to use the binary search algorithm to solve this problem because the array was pretty much
sorted and needed to just add a check so that I can check the sorted array correctly

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(log(n))   when n is the size of the array
* Space complexity: 0(1)
    
    
## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
